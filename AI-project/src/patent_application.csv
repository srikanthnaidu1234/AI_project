Epilepsy means paroxysmal or repetitive abnormalities in muscle contraction, consciousness, perception, behavioral movement, or an autonomic nervous system, caused by sudden abnormal excitability of nerve cells in the brain, and is characterized by a chronic recurrent seizure caused by pathological lesions in the brain. In epilepsy, epileptiform discharges are detected in electroencephalograms in many cases. However, for example, when no seizure occurs, epileptiform discharges are not necessarily detected. Meanwhile, even when epileptiform discharges are detected in electroencephalograms, some cases are not diagnosed as epilepsy. The prevalence of epilepsy is about from eight to ten people per one thousand people. Epilepsy is a disease having a high frequency in neurological diseases. Examples of a main symptom of epilepsy include convulsive seizure (involuntary movement such as tonic seizure or clonic seizure) and an absence seizure (loss of consciousness) without a convulsive component. In recent years, causative genes of epilepsy have been identified by the development of molecular genetics study. As a result, a relationship between epilepsy and various channel genes has become evident. It has come to be considered that some epilepsy syndromes are so-called channelopathy caused by mutations in channel genes. Particularly, mutations of a voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channel, a voltage-dependent Na + channel or K + channel, and the like have been detected in epileptic patients. As for a current therapeutic agent for epilepsy, a synthetic compound is administered orally, a suppository is administered, or administration is performed intravenously. Examples of the current therapeutic agent for epileptic patients include an oral administration agent of a synthetic compound such as a channel blocker. Particularly in status epilepticus, a fast-acting medication is desired. Therefore, intravenous injection of a medical substance is performed. However, there is a problem due to at least (1) to (3) described below. (1) There is a drug-resistant epilepsy syndrome, and in some cases, an effect is still insufficient. (2) In status epilepticus, it is necessary to administer a medical substance intravenously, while this treatment cannot be performed to a patient whose intravenous line is not easily ensured (such as children). (3) In a case of an unpredictable seizure on admission, it is possible to administer a medical substance intravenously. However, in a case of an unpredictable seizure at home or the like, it is not possible to administer a medical substance intravenously, and oral administration takes too much time before an effect thereof appears, therefore prolonged convulsive seizure results in increasing the risk of a sequela. In a case of an unpredictable seizure, a hospitalized patient can be treated by intravenous administration. However, in a case of non-admission, a fast-acting medication (prior art) does not exist. This is because oral administration or a suppository takes much time before effects thereof appear. As an anti-epileptic drug which can be used when a sufficient effect cannot be obtained with other epileptic drugs, acetazolamide (AZA) is known (Non Patent Literature 1). Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and inhibits a carbonic anhydrase in a process of producing water and carbon dioxide from carbonic acid. It is known that, as a result, excretion of sodium bicarbonate is increased and metabolic acidosis is thereby caused. However, acetazolamide is an internal medicine, and therefore has no fast-acting property against an unpredictable seizure outside a hospital. In addition, there is a risk of lowering a blood pH excessively by administration thereof. Furthermore, as an important side effect, a central nervous symptom such as shock, anemia (aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenic purpura), mucocutaneous ocular syndrome, toxic epidermal necrosis, acute renal failure, renal-urinary tract stone, mental confusion, or convulsive seizure, may appear. Acetazolamide also has a problem that it takes too much time before an effect thereof appears. Therefore, it is desired to develop a therapeutic agent for an epileptic seizure, which is easily handled, has a low side effect, and has a fast-acting property. It has been reported that when 8-11 days-old rats are placed at 48±2° C. for 55 minutes, alkalosis in the brain triggers febrile seizures and that alkalosis in the brain can be suppressed by placing the rats in a chamber containing 5% carbon dioxide (Non Patent Literature 2). However, there is no report of study of an effect of carbon dioxide on epilepsy. It is considered that febrile seizures are caused by a complex combination of a genetic factor, a degree of body temperature, and an immaturity of neuron. However, this report (Non Patent Literature 2) does not consider the genetic factor having the largest importance.",<SOH> SUMMARY OF INVENTION <EOH>,"TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges, characterized by containing carbon dioxide as an active ingredient.

(Reference Example 1) DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS The present invention relates to a therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges, characterized by containing carbon dioxide as an active ingredient. In the present invention, the disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges is not limited to epilepsy, but means any disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges. Here, the epileptiform discharge means spike, spike and wave, spike-and-wave complex, sharp wave, sharp and slow waves, or the like. In the present invention, specific examples of the disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges include epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, and metabolic abnormalities (hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities). Febrile seizures not relating to epilepsy are not included in the scope of the present invention. In the present invention, the disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges is preferably epilepsy. A difference between epilepsy and febrile seizures is as follows. That is, febrile seizure is a benign disease which occurs when a person has fever. Epilepsy is developed when a person has no fever, and a symptom, duration, and prognosis tend to become severe. Higher organisms including humans produce carbon dioxide by consuming oxygen in the body in order to obtain energy necessary for life activities. Carbon dioxide generated in the body is transferred to the lung through venous blood. The lung releases carbon dioxide from the blood, and incorporates oxygen into the blood by breathing. Various organic acids are synthesized in the body by life activities. By an action of regulation mechanisms, the pH normal value is maintained at 7.35 to 7.45 as an environment in the body. The therapeutic agent of the present invention for a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges contains carbon dioxide as an active ingredient. In the present invention, carbon dioxide is used for temporarily lowering a blood pH to a value lower than 7.4 and not interfering with life. Specifically, the blood pH is only required to be temporarily lowered to 7.25-7.40, preferably to 7.30-7.35. In order to lower the blood pH as described above, carbon dioxide gas can be inhaled to be used. Specifically, the therapeutic agent of the present invention for a disease of the present invention can be a therapeutic agent for inhalation, containing carbon dioxide as an active ingredient. The present invention further relates to a medical gas bottle or a medical inhalation gas device for a therapy of a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges. The therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges, containing carbon dioxide as an active ingredient, may be filled in a medical gas bottle, or the medical gas bottle may be connected to a medical inhalation gas device. Carbon dioxide is filled in such a therapeutic agent for inhalation, medical gas bottle, or medical inhalation gas device such that the concentration of carbon dioxide in inhaled gas upon inhalation is from 1 to 10% (v/v), preferably from 3 to 10% (v/v), and more preferably from 5 to 10% (v/v). It is said that the following usually occurs according to the concentration of carbon dioxide gas in the air. That is, a concentration of 1 to 2% (v/v) causes discomfort. A concentration of 3 to 4% (v/v) stimulates the respiratory center, and causes such a symptom as increase in respiration, elevation in pulse rate, headache, or dizziness. A concentration of 6 to 7% (v/v) makes breathing difficult. A concentration of 7 to 10% (v/v) causes unconsciousness in a few minutes. Therefore, the concentration of carbon dioxide used in the present invention is only required to be able to temporarily lower the blood pH and not to interfere with life upon inhalation. Carbon dioxide is a colorless and odorless gas at a normal temperature and pressure, and is sublimated at −79° C. to become a solid (dry ice). Carbon dioxide is soluble in water relatively well, and an aqueous solution thereof (carbonic acid) is weakly acidic. Furthermore, an aqueous solution and a solid of a hydroxide of an alkali metal and an alkaline earth metal absorb carbon dioxide, and generate a carbonate or a bicarbonate. Carbon dioxide is liquefied under temperature and pressure conditions of the triple point (−56.6° C., 0.52 MPa) or more. Carbon dioxide becomes a supercritical state under temperature and pressure conditions exceeding the critical point (31.1° C., 7.4 MPa), and has features of both gas and liquid. Carbon dioxide in these states is referred to as compressed carbon dioxide or high-density carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide contained in the therapeutic agent for inhalation, the medical gas bottle, or the medical inhalation gas device of the present invention is only required to be gas upon inhalation. A generation source of carbon dioxide gas may be gas, liquid, or solid such as dry ice. The therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges of the present invention can contain components of the normal air (nitrogen, oxygen, argon) in addition to carbon dioxide. The therapeutic agent may further contain a gas component which does not adversely affect a living body, for example, helium. The present invention relates to the above-described therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges, gas bottle for a therapy of a disease, and inhalation gas device for a therapy of a disease, and also relates to a method for treating a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges, characterized in that the therapeutic agent for a disease is inhaled using a gas bottle for a therapy of a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges or an inhalation gas device for a therapy of a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges. For example, by placing the gas bottle or device of the present invention for a therapy of a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges at homes or educational institutions or by carrying a small gas bottle, when a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges occur, it is possible to easily reduce a symptom such as a seizure accompanied by the disease by inhaling, from the bottle, a therapeutic agent containing carbon dioxide as an active ingredient, specifically carbon dioxide gas, the concentration of which is from 1 to 10% (v/v), preferably from 3 to 10% (v/v), and more preferably from 5 to 10% (v/v) in inhaled gas. EXAMPLES The present invention will be described specifically by showing Examples, Comparative Examples, and Reference Examples, in order to assist in understanding the present invention. However, of course, the present invention is not limited thereto. Example 1 Administration of Carbon Dioxide to Epileptic Model Rats In the present Example, carbon dioxide at each concentration was administered to GRY rats. The blood pH, the blood concentration of carbon dioxide, and electroencephalograms were measured. A simultaneous video-electroencephalographic recording technology was established, and a spike index as an index of evaluation of a seizure was measured. 1) Material and Method [Epileptic Model Rat] In the present Example, a GRY rat (groggy rat, Cacnala) was used as an epileptic model rat. A GRY rat constantly develops an epileptic seizure in normal conditions, and therefore is an extremely excellent system to evaluate a seizure by subjecting the GRY rat to a treatment. The GRY rat has a mutation in an α1 subunit of a P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel Cav2.1 which encodes Cacnala gene, and is an epileptic model rat which mainly develops ataxia and absence seizure. The GRY rat takes a mode of autosomal recessive inheritance. The 752nd nucleotide “T” of the Cacnala gene has mutated to “A”. As a result, a codon “ATG” to specify methionine which is the 251st amino acid has mutated to a codon “AAG” to specify lysine (M251K). It has been reported that this mutation is located at extracellular p-loop forming a pore of a calcium channel domain 1 and that this mutation (M251K) results in abnormality of a function of the voltage-dependent calcium ion channel Cav2.1 of the rat (Reference Literatures 1 and 2). The GRY rats with this mutation show extension abnormalities of hind limbs, walking abnormalities, and ataxia, and a seizure which is accompanied with spike and wave discharges of 7-8 Hz on the electroencephalograms from 6-8 weeks of age. The present model rats were dispensed from Institute of Laboratory Animals, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University. [Surgery of Embedding Electrode for Measurement of Electroencephalograms] Male GRY rats were anesthetized by administering 35 mg/kg of pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co. Ltd.) intraperitoneally, and were fixed to a brain stereotaxic fixing apparatus (SR-5M, NARISHIGE Group). The head was shaved, the skin was incised along the median line, and the skull was exposed. A small hole was opened on the frontal lobe cortex and the occipital lobe cortex on both sides using a dental drill (FALCON, Morita Corporation). A stainless steel screw electrode (FUKUOKA RASHI) having a diameter of 0.9 mm and a length of 1.7 mm and connected a stainless steel wire having a diameter of 0.2 mm (MT Giken) was embedded in the hole (refer to FIG. 1). A screw electrode was embedded in the root of nose as a Z electrode, and a screw electrode was embedded in the cerebellum as an indifferent electrode. Each electrode was connected to a connector socket (Hirose Electric Co. Ltd.), and fixed to the skull with dental cement (Uni Fast II, GC Dental Products). [Control of Concentration of Carbon Dioxide] In order to control a concentration of carbon dioxide, multi-gas incubator (MCO-5M; Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd.) was used as a multi-gas concentration control apparatus to adjust the concentration of carbon dioxide in the incubator. A concentration of oxygen was also adjusted for comparison. Main components of the normal dry air are 0.032% (v/v) of carbon dioxide, 20.946% (v/v) of oxygen, and 78.084% (v/v) of nitrogen. Therefore, using the above-described multi-gas concentration control apparatus, the concentration of carbon dioxide was set to 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v), or the concentration of oxygen was set to 17% (v/v). When the concentration of carbon dioxide was adjusted, carbon dioxide gas supplied from a carbon dioxide gas bottle connected to the apparatus was diluted with the air outside. Therefore, carbon dioxide=10% (v/v), oxygen=about 18.85% (v/v), and nitrogen=about 70.28% (v/v). When the concentration of oxygen was set to 17% (v/v), similarly, the concentration was adjusted using nitrogen gas supplied from a nitrogen gas bottle connected to the apparatus. Therefore, carbon dioxide=0.026% (v/v), oxygen=about 17% (v/v), and nitrogen=about 82.974% (v/v). It was confirmed using a gas analyzer AGA-2008 (Astec Co. Ltd.) that each concentration in the incubator was correct under the set conditions. 2) Administration of Carbon Dioxide at Each Concentration to Rats The surgery of embedding an electrode for measurement of electroencephalograms was performed to eight male GRY rats (9 weeks old). After a one-week recovery period, the GRY rats were placed for one hour in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus adjusted to a concentration of carbon dioxide of 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v), or a concentration of oxygen of 17% (v/v). 3) Blood pH, Concentration of Carbon Dioxide Blood samples were collected from the tail vein of the rats placed in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus, and the blood pH and the blood concentration of carbon dioxide were measured using an i-STAT analyzer (Fuso Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.) as a blood gas analyzer. It was confirmed that the blood concentration of carbon dioxide of the rats was increased in accordance with increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus to 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v), and that the blood concentration of carbon dioxide of rats was reduced when the concentration of oxygen in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus was changed to 17% (v/v). The blood pH was measured in similar conditions. As a result, the blood pH was reduced in accordance with increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus to 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v), and that the blood pH was increased when the concentration of oxygen in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus was changed to 17% (v/v). This makes it clear that the blood concentration of carbon dioxide was increased and the blood pH was reduced when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus was changed to 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v) (FIG. 2). When the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, a high concentration of carbon dioxide is taken in as inhaled air. As a result, respiratory acidosis occurs. On the other hand, when the concentration of oxygen is reduced, a respiratory rate is increased. As a result, a large amount of carbon dioxide is released, and respiratory alkalosis occurs. Here, the acidosis means a state in which an original acid-base equilibrium of blood is kept to have a pH of 7.4 but the equilibrium goes to an acidic side. The alkalosis means a state in which the acid-base equilibrium of blood goes to a basic side. The pH of blood or body fluids is represented by the following Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH=pKa+log [HCO3−]/[CO2] (pKa=6.1) A bicarbonic acid-carbon dioxide (HCO3−/CO2) buffer system is the most important pH buffer system of blood or body fluids. Carbon dioxide reacts with a water molecule in the body to generate bicarbonic acid. CO2+H2O←→HCO3+H+ [CO2] is regulated by breathing, and [HCO3−] is regulated by the liver and kidney. Therefore, it is considered that the therapeutic agent of the present invention for a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges causes respiratory acidosis by increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide of inhaled air with carbon dioxide contained as an active ingredient, and suppresses epileptiform discharges. In a case of a healthy person, the blood pH is usually 7.4 (normal range of female=pH 7.40±0.015, normal range of male=pH 7.39±0.015). It is said that the blood pH of 7.0 or less or 7.8 or more makes life support impossible. In the present Example, the pH was 7.27 in an environment of 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide. 4) Evaluation of Seizure The rats placed in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus adjusted to a concentration of carbon dioxide of 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v) were subjected to simultaneous video-electroencephalographic recording. Rats placed in the air were used as a control. Electroencephalograms of the frontal lobe cortex and the occipital lobe cortex of the rats were measured using an electroencephalograph (Neurofax EEG-1200, NIHON KOHDEN CORPORATION). A spike index was used as an index of evaluation of a seizure. The spike index represents a ratio of duration of a spike in measurement time (15 minutes). The spike means a waveform indicating a sharp change in potential in a short time (refer to FIG. 3). FIG. 4 illustrates electroencephalograms according to a change in the concentration of mixed gas of inhaled air. FIG. 5 illustrates results of the spike index. As a result, it was confirmed that epileptiform discharges, that is, duration of a spike could be suppressed significantly by changing the concentration of carbon dioxide to 7% (v/v) or 10% (v/v). Example 2 Administration of Carbon Dioxide to Epileptic Model Rats 2 Male GRY rats (9 weeks old) were placed for one hour in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus adjusted to a concentration of carbon dioxide of 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v), or a concentration of oxygen of 17% (v/v) by the same manner as in Example 1 (six rats for each). The blood concentration of carbon dioxide, the blood concentration of oxygen, and the blood concentration of a bicarbonate ion were measured for model rats under each condition. It was confirmed that the blood concentration of carbon dioxide of the rats was increased in accordance with increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide to 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v), and that the blood concentration of carbon dioxide of rats was reduced when the concentration of oxygen was changed to 17% (v/v) (FIG. 6). FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate the blood concentration of oxygen and the blood concentration of a bicarbonate ion under similar conditions. The results in Examples 1 and 2 make it clear that the blood concentration of carbon dioxide was increased and the blood pH was reduced when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus was changed to 5% (v/v), 7% (v/v), or 10% (v/v). Example 3 Administration of Carbon Dioxide to Epileptic Model Rats 3 In the present Example, when 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide or 17% (v/v) oxygen was administered to GRY rats in different administration times, the blood pH, the blood concentration of carbon dioxide, the blood concentration of oxygen, and the blood concentration of a bicarbonate ion were measured. 1) Material and Method A model animal was the same as in Example 1, and control of a concentration of carbon dioxide was performed by the same manner as in Example 1. Carbon dioxide or oxygen was administered to rats by placing the rats in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus adjusted to a concentration of carbon dioxide of 10% (v/v) or a concentration of oxygen of 17% (v/v) for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or 60 minutes (5-6 rats for each). Rats placed in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus adjusted to a concentration of the normal air were used as a control. The blood pH and concentrations of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and a bicarbonate ion were measured by the same manner as in Example 1 or 2. 2) Measurement Results of Blood pH and Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen, and Bicarbonate Ion Measurement results of the blood pH, the blood concentration of carbon dioxide, the blood concentration of oxygen, and the blood concentration of a bicarbonate ion in the above-described rats are illustrated in FIG. 9. It was confirmed that administration of 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide increased the blood concentration of carbon dioxide and reduced the blood pH for 15 to 60 minutes. Example 4 Administration of Carbon Dioxide to Epileptic Model Rats 4 In the present Example, GRY rats were administered with 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide, and subjected to simultaneous video-electroencephalographic recording, and an effect of suppressing an epileptic seizure (spike index) was measured. 1) Material and Method A model animal was the same as in Example 1, and a surgery of embedding an electrode for measurement of electroencephalograms, control of a concentration of carbon dioxide, and measurement of electroencephalograms were performed by the same manner as in Example 1. Carbon dioxide was administered to rats by placing the rats in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus adjusted to a concentration of carbon dioxide of 10% (v/v) (9 rats). 2) Evaluation of Seizure FIG. 10 illustrates results of measuring, by the same manner as in Example 1, electroencephalograms of the frontal lobe cortex and the occipital lobe cortex of the rats to which 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide had been administered by placing the rats in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus. FIG. 10 illustrates an electroencephalogram for five minutes before the administration of 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide and an electroencephalogram for five minutes from 25 seconds after starting the administration. As a result, it was confirmed that epileptiform discharges, that is, duration of a spike could be suppressed significantly by administering the therapeutic agent of the present invention (10% (v/v) carbon dioxide). 3) Experiment of Suppressing Seizure By placing the rats in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus, the rats were administered with 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide, and subjected to simultaneous video-electroencephalographic recording every 15 minutes for one hour, and an effect of suppressing an epileptic seizure (spike index) was measured before and after the administration of carbon dioxide. FIG. 11 illustrates results of a spike index every 15 minutes before and after the administration of 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide. When the spike index for 15 minutes before the administration of carbon dioxide was assumed to be 1, an average spike index was 0.0074 in the initial 15 minutes (0-15 minutes), was 0.054 in the subsequent 15 minutes (16-30 minutes), was 0.275 in the subsequent 15 minutes (31-45 minutes), and was 0.416 in the subsequent 15 minutes (46-60 minutes). From the above results, it was confirmed that the therapeutic agent of the present invention (10% (v/v) carbon dioxide) could suppress a seizure almost completely 15 minutes after the administration, that this effect of suppressing a seizure could last at least until 30 minutes after the administration, and that the suppressing effect gradually decreased. The above Example 3 indicates that the blood concentration of carbon dioxide and the blood pH did not change much for the initial one hour after the administration of carbon dioxide, but that the effect of suppressing a seizure gradually decreased 31-45 minutes and 46-60 minutes after the administration of 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide. It is considered that the effect of suppressing a seizure gradually decreased due to some reasons, in spite of maintaining the decreased level of the blood pH for 31-60 minutes after the administration of carbon dioxide. Comparative Example 1 Comparative Example Using Acetazolamide Acetazolamide (Acetazolamide, trade name “Diamox®”, “Acetamox®”) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and inhibits a carbonic anhydrase in a process of producing water and carbon dioxide from carbonic acid. As a result, excretion of sodium bicarbonate is increased and metabolic acidosis is thereby caused. First, the blood concentration and the blood pH after administration of acetazolamide were measured. Acetazolamide (50 mg/kg) was administered to male GRY rats intraperitoneally. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein before the administration, 15 minute, 30 minute, 45 minutes and 60 minutes after the administration. The blood concentration of acetazolamide, the blood pH, and the blood bicarbonate ion were measured. Saline was administered as a control (8 rats for each). Measurement of the blood concentration of acetazolamide was entrusted to SRL Inc. to be performed. The pH was measured by the same manner as in Example 1. The blood concentration of acetazolamide after the administration of acetazolamide was the highest 15 minutes after the administration and decreased with time (FIG. 12). The blood pH of the acetazolamide administration group was significantly low (on an acidic side) 15 minutes, 30 minute, 45 minutes, and 60 minutes after the administration as compared with the control group (FIG. 12). The blood bicarbonate ion of the acetazolamide administration group was significantly low 15 minutes, 30 minute, 45 minutes, and 60 minutes after the administration as compared with the control group, although data is not illustrated. It was found that the blood pH was acidic within 60 minutes after the administration of acetazolamide in this condition due to non-respiratory (metabolic) acidosis. Next, electroencephalograms were measured. 9 weeks old GRY rats were fixed to a brain stereotaxic fixing apparatus under anesthesia with pentobarbital, and a chronic electrode for measurement of electroencephalograms was embedded in the frontal lobe cortex and the occipital lobe cortex by the same manner as in Example 1 (refer to FIG. 1). One week after the surgery, acetazolamide (50 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, and the measurement of electroencephalograms was started (administration group: 10 rats, non-administration group: 10 rats). The measurement of electroencephalograms and calculation of the spike index were performed by the same manner as in Example 1. As a result, it has been revealed that acetazolamide significantly suppresses (reduces) the spike duration of a seizure (FIG. 13). Elapsed time of the action showed a correlation with the blood pH and the change in the bicarbonate ion. As described above, it has been indicated that an epileptic seizure can be suppressed also by the administration of acetazolamide. However, 30 minutes after the administration of acetazolamide (50 mg/kg), the pH was 7.08±0.03. This suggests that the pH may become a very dangerous value for vital (refer to FIG. 12). Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. However, carbon dioxide in the present invention does not act on a specific enzyme activity unlike acetazolamide, and therefore is considered to be safer. Reference Example 1 Administration of Carbon Dioxide to Epileptic Model Rats In the present Reference Example, 10% (v/v) carbon dioxide was administered to Kyo811 rats. The blood pH and electroencephalograms were measured. The rats were subjected to simultaneous video-electroencephalographic recording, and seizure duration was measured. 1) Material and Method [Epileptic Model Rat] In epilepsy, about 80% of patients of intractable Dravet syndrome (formerly, referred to as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy: SMEI), and about 5-10% of patients of benign generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus: GEFS+) have missense mutations in a voltage-dependent sodium channel α subunit type 1 (SCN1A) gene. Therefore, it is considered that the mutations in the SCN1A gene are involved in development of febrile seizures (Reference Literatures 3 and 4). In the present Reference Example, using the Kyo811 rats having a mutation in the Scn1a gene as a genetic factor, suppressive effect of seizure by carbon dioxide was examined. This rat is a febrile seizure model rat which induces febrile seizures by a thermal load, and a GEFS+ model rat. A Kyo811 rat was prepared as a rat with a mutation in the voltage-dependent sodium channel Scn1a gene by the following technology. That is, a mutagen (N-nitro-N-ethylurea; ENU) was introduced into the peritoneal cavity of a male F344 rat, and an artificial mutation was introduced into the DNA of a sperm. Thereafter, the sperm was extracted, and the obtained sperm was subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection into an egg of a female rat (Reference Literature 5). As a result of a genetic analysis, in the Kyo811 rat, the 4251th nucleotide “A” of the Scn1a gene has been mutated to “C”, and as result, asparagine (AAT) as the 1417th amino acid has been changed to histidine (CAT) (N1417H). The 1417th asparagine is located in a pore-forming region involved in ion transmission of a sodium ion channel third domain. As a result of a functional analysis of the mutant voltage-dependent sodium channel, it has been found that the N1417H mutant sodium ion channel has an abnormality in the channel function, and easily causes seizure. This mutant homozygous rat causes febrile seizures about 3-4 minutes after the rat is put in a warm bath at 45° C. Therefore, the rat is very useful as a febrile seizure model rat upon a warm bath load. The present model rats were dispensed from Institute of Laboratory Animals, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University. [Surgery of Embedding Electrode for Measurement of Electroencephalograms] The surgery was performed by the same manner as in Example 1 [Control of Concentration of Carbon Dioxide] The control was performed by the same manner as in Example 1. 2) Induction of Febrile Seizures of Rats with Thermal Load Chronic electrodes for measurement of electroencephalograms were embedded in male Kyo811 rats (5 weeks old) by the same manner as in Example 1 (5 rats for each). After a one-week recovery period, the rats were put into a warm bath at 45° C. for about 3-4 minutes to induce febrile seizures, and electroencephalograms were measured. 3) Administration of Carbon Dioxide to Rats Immediately after the seizure was induced, the rats were placed in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus adjusted to the concentration of carbon dioxide of 10% (v/v) or the concentration of the normal air, and the situation of the seizure was observed while electroencephalograms were measured continuously. 4) Blood pH As soon as the seizures of the rats placed in the multi-gas concentration control apparatus were terminated, blood samples were collected from the tail vein of the rats by the same manner as in Example 1, and the blood pH was measured using an i-stat analyzer as a blood gas analyzer (5 rats for each). As a control, the blood pH of the rats (10 rats) before induction of febrile seizures was measured. As a result, it was confirmed that the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide to 10% (v/v) reduced the blood pH of the rats (FIG. 14). 5) Evaluation of Seizure Electroencephalograms of the frontal lobe cortex and the occipital lobe cortex of the rats were measured by the same manner as in Example 1. An example of the data is illustrated. As a result, it was confirmed that epileptiform discharges, that is, duration of a spike could be suppressed significantly by changing the concentration of carbon dioxide to 10% (v/v) (FIG. 15). Results of seizure duration (second) are illustrated (FIG. 16). It was confirmed that a seizure could be suppressed significantly by changing the concentration of carbon dioxide to 10% (v/v). 6) Result As described above, it was confirmed that, even in Kyo811 rats as a more severe epileptic model, the blood pH was reduced by the administration of carbon dioxide, and that electroencephalograms were improved.

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY As described in detail above, in the present invention, by placing the gas bottle, the device, or the like for a therapy of a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges at homes or educational institutions or by carrying a small gas bottle, when a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges occur, it is possible to easily reduce a symptom such as a seizure accompanied by the disease by inhaling, from the bottle, a therapeutic agent containing carbon dioxide as an active ingredient, specifically carbon dioxide gas. In addition, by development of a gas bottle or an inhalation gas device using the therapeutic agent of the present invention for a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges, the following effects are expected. (1) An effect of suppressing a seizure is fast-acting. (2) In a case of an unpredictable seizure at home or the like, surrounding persons (family members or the like) can cope therewith easily. (3) Use thereof is simple. (4) It is inexpensive. (5) In status epilepticus, it is necessary to administer a medical substance intravenously. A fast-acting medication can be performed to a patient whose intravenous line is not easily ensured (such as children). (6) When an epilepsy syndrome which is not easily suppressed with conventional medical substances is treated or status epilepticus is treated in an intensive care unit, it is possible to suppress a seizure while breathing is completely controlled. Due to the present invention, it is possible to expect an incomparably better therapy which is applicable immediately upon a seizure and has a fast-acting property than in administration of a conventional therapeutic agent. Particularly, many of the epileptic patients are children, and therefore it is expected to make a system in which a handy inhalation gas (bottle) is placed at each home to be able to cope with a seizure immediately. It is said that about one million epileptic patients are present in Japan. The therapeutic agent of the present invention can act effectively not only against epilepsy but also a disease accompanied by epileptiform discharges. Therefore, a larger market therefor is expected.",A61K3300,A61K3300,20160122,,20160616,57686.0
